### Project-3: HomeMe

### About the Project

HomeMe is a web application for renters in the Greater Los Angeles area who need a more streamlined housing search application with their roommates. Unlike RadPad and Zillow, our app lets users communicate with their roommates/housemates during the search process within the same web application avoiding the back and forth email chains.
